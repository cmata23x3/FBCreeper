Chrome plugin for Facebook Creeper

Idea is to create a Chrome plugin that allows the user to deactivate links that would not be desired while creeping on other users. 

Ex. Person finds someone they vaguely know from 5 years ago and want to look through their pictures. During their perusing, Person accidentally likes a picture from 3 years ago. Person has been busted from 'creepin' and now proceeds to feel awkward for the next 10 minutes.
